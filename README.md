# How to Build Machine Learning Pipelines with TensorFlow Extended(TFX)

‚ÑπÔ∏è Machine learning is a highly sought-after technology, and for a good reason. It is helping to improve decision-making and increase efficiency in various industries. Therefore, many of us have learned how to build an ML pipeline. However, there's a big difference between the Academic ML pipeline (Data-centric AI Development) and the Production ML lifecycle (Model-centric AI Development). Academic ML is about the highest overall accuracy, while Production ML is about fast inference, good interpretability, and the entire system. 

üìå Hence, I tried to make this tutorial show us how to use TensorFlow Extended (TFX) to build machine learning lifecycles that bridge the gap between academic and production machine learning. TFX is a powerful tool that makes deploying models in production environments a breeze. By the end of this tutorial, we will know how to use TFX to develop, test, and deploy machine learning models. 

üçª Welcome any feedback or suggestions to ensure this tutorial is as helpful as possible!
